# image2video

This is a small and simple shell script that uses ffmpeg to convert an image and an audio track to a video file.
I and probably other people rarely use ffmpeg directly, so I wrote down the command line in a little script so that I don't have to look up every time how it works.

Usage:
```
$ image2video <image_file> <audio_file> <output_video_file>
```
